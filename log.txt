= Added the ability to abort scrambling;

Bugfixes:

= Using extra spaces in variation and weight fields will not yield errors anymore;

= Previewing will not mess with the global audio (Other programs' sound will continue to work as intended);
= Closing the program now works as intended;
= You can now open files from folders whose name contains non-ANSI characters;


[v2.2.1]

Changes/Features:

= Added "start onsets" and start onset files -- they kind of work like average start times, but for onset files; (Keep in mind that just like start times, they are optional)
= Added the ability to import MP3 files without the need of FFmpeg*;
*Installing FFmpeg is still recommended though, as importing MP3 files is faster that way + more audio formats are supported;

Bugfixes:

= The "Minimum fade backmask" parameter now works as intended;
= Got rid of the long pause between scrambling and previewing;
= The lognormal distribution mode is no longer affected by the time measure mode;
= The folded normal mode isâ€‹ now affected by the time measure mode instead;


[v2.2.2]

= Minor bugfixes (stumbling, note extension);
= Ignore onsets checkbox turned to "Erase onsets" button;
= Advanced tab redesign;
= Added more import formats (Preferences > Show more import formats);

= File menu: added a "Preset backup" submenu;
= File menu:  Added a "Restore the last seed" option for random seeds;
= Removed raw data import;
= Python script: enabling AB_DISABLE_SIMPLEAUDIO doesn't remove ability to preview;
= Python script: added AB_DONT_USE_B64_ICON;
= Added "Percent change" and "Speed multiplier" speed modes;
= Added Python info into the About box;
= Stumbling: Added "Chance to deviate";
= About: The license is now hosted on the Internet;
