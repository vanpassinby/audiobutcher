[v2.2.0]

Scrambling changes / Features:

= Compensations have been changed to weight-type fade modes;
= Added automatic and manual onset detection;
= Added onset files;
= Added 2 quantization modes: BPM, Onsets;
= Added audio trimming;
= Added segment reappearing - Each segment can now have a chance to reappear after a given amount of segments;
= Added fade-related chances ('Apply fades before reversing', 'Fade only into pauses');
= Added 'Folded Normal Distribution' as a scramble mode
= Added backmask fading;
= Added measure types for fading and repeating segments(by length or percentage);
= Added the ability to input random seeds;
= Double segment size has been changed from a checkbox to a % chance;
= Added 'Backwards-only' as a stumbling mode;

User interface changes / Features:

= Added hotkeys;
= The chosen time measure applies everywhere now (set to milliseconds by default);
= Preview length options have been extended to a maximum of 60s long;
= Ability to stop previewing anytime;
= Preview options now have their own submenu;
= Misc. option submenu;
= Presets have changed a little, however v2.1.0 presets are still compatible with v2.2.0;
= Unique filename generation (which uses UNIX timestamps);
= The advanced tab has been redesigned;
= Detailed error information;
= The Github script can now run on Linux and MacOS without any further modifications;
= More parameters are now being remembered after restarting (preview and export length + misc menu parameters);
= The audio filename now shows up in AudioButcher's window title;
= Added the ability to import raw data;
= Added the ability to abort scrambling;

Bugfixes:

= Using extra spaces in variation and weight fields will not yield errors anymore;
= Stumbled audio will no longer start playing from the beginning several times;
= Previewing will not mess with the global audio (Other programs' sound will continue to work as intended);
= Closing the program now works as intended;
= You can now open files from folders whose name contains non-ANSI characters;


[v2.2.1]

Changes/Features:

= Added "start onsets" and start onset files -- they kind of work like average start times, but for onset files; (Keep in mind that just like start times, they are optional)
= Added the ability to import MP3 files without the need of FFmpeg*;
*Installing FFmpeg is still recommended though, as importing MP3 files is faster that way + more audio formats are supported;

Bugfixes:

= The "Minimum fade backmask" parameter now works as intended;
= Got rid of the long pause between scrambling and previewing;
= The lognormal distribution mode is no longer affected by the time measure mode;
= The folded normal mode isâ€‹ now affected by the time measure mode instead;


[v2.2.2]

= Minor bugfixes (stumbling, note extension);
= Ignore onsets checkbox turned to "Erase onsets" button;
= Advanced tab redesign;
= Added more import formats (Preferences > Show more import formats);
= Advanced: changed the stumbling mode into a weight system, like the fade mode weights;
= Advanced: added "Fade cutoffs";
= File menu: added a "Preset backup" submenu;
= File menu:  Added a "Restore the last seed" option for random seeds;
= Removed raw data import;
= Python script: enabling AB_DISABLE_SIMPLEAUDIO doesn't remove ability to preview;
= Python script: added AB_DONT_USE_B64_ICON;
= Added "Percent change" and "Speed multiplier" speed modes;
= Added Python info into the About box;
= Stumbling: Added "Chance to deviate";
= About: The license is now hosted on the Internet;
= .ABP files can now be opened via dragging the file over the executable icon (not to be confused with the program window)


[v2.2.3]

= Fixed start onsets; 
= Speed and start time weights entry can be left empty for equal weighting;
= Separated start onset list file from "usual" onset list;
= Slightly improved the BPM quantization mode;
= Added the ability to drag & drop files directly to AB window: specifically audio, preset and both types of onset files;
= Added the ability to export audio in FLAC;
= Added the ability to specify note extension crossfade;
= The pared version of AB now contains the "aubio" Python module which allows onset detection (however its detection quality is much lower).
= Bugfix: The "Manage onsets" window now reappears after editing onsets;


[v3.0.0]

This version has been created from scratch. However, here's some differences from AB2:

= Reworked GUI;
= Added looping;
= Added segment muting;
= Added skipping to stumbling;
= Removed fade compensation modes;
= Added more options to note extension;
= Added more export formats.


[v4.0.0]
= AB has been rewritten from scratch;
= GUI has been completely reworked;
= AB's icon has been updated;
= Available on-screen option hints;
= FFmpeg now can be located without changing the system path variable;
= Certain parameters, previously accessible from source code, now can be changed via system variables;
= Insane performance improvements;
= Partial generation - It allows you to change parameters within one scramble;
= New random distribution - Exponential;
= Reappeared segments now can reappear multiple times by certain chance;
= Main speed and speed variations are now separated;
= Length scaling for slowed down/sped up segments;
= Average start time parameters has been moved to Pattern tab;
= Backmasking and Note extension are now merged into the more universal Sustain parameters;
= 5 Sustain parameter sets, with mini-presets menu accessible via right click;
= Stumbling has been replaced by Loop and Pattern parameters;
= Added Framing mode - it overrides certain AB behaviors, making the scrambler work similarly to Spectrasonics' Stylus RMX;
= AB3 "looping" has been removed, now Framing is its alternative;
= Onsets (or rather, audio between them) are now called Slices;
= You can now watch the length statistics for Slices;
= Better way to control where Alternative slices (former Start onsets) are used;
= Added new slice (onset) detection methods with sensitivity support: One spectrogram-based (Standard), and two amplitude-based (RMS and STE).
= The old onset detection method is still available as "Classic";
= "Pared" version does not use the aubio library anymore, but it does support RMS and STE onset detection modes;
= You can now import a MIDI file as an onset file via "Edit onsets" window;
= Segment placement position shifting and quantization;
= Automatic segment volume change options;
= Segment intro loop;
= Small parameters to tweak certain behaviors;
= Implemented ABPL (AudioButcher Programming Language), which allows creating complex dependencies between segment parameters;
= The executable release is now running in Python 3.11, and is available on both Windows and macOS!
